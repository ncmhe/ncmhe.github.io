Recent advances in AI help improving our understanding on dynamic human crowd motion and behavior. These advances provide essential grounds for modeling and simulating human crowd under various environmental conditions such as architectural structures (e.g. buildings, stations, stadiums, museums, airports). There is a growing recent interest in identifying relationship between human (crowd) behavior and the built environmental structures, utilizing recent developments in AI and machine learning techniques as well as incorporating findings from perceptual, cognitive principles.

This inaugural IJCAI-PRICAI 2020 Workshop aims to initiate the first-of-its-kind gathering of multidisciplinary experts interested in this area. This multidisciplinary approach combines cognitive principles and many different areas of machine learning to study the relationship between human behavior and the spaces they inhabit. It will also provide a platform for discussion on collecting appropriate data and challenges in the future gatherings.

# Call for Contributions

We are looking for submissions of position papers and work-in-progress extended abstracts (2 pages) on the relevant topics, including but not limited to:
- Identifying existing challenges in the modeling of humans and environments
- Identifying and analyzing the relationships between human (crowd) and various environments
- Novel neuro-cognitive models for human (crowd) motion and behavior
- Deep learning-based models
- Reinforcement learning-based models
- Graph-based representation learning models
- Applications of neuro-cognitive models for human (crowd) and environment
- Datasets for studying human (crowd) and environment relationships

# How to Submit

Papers must be no longer than 2 pages in IJCAI-PRICAI format. The official template can be downloaded from the link [here](https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit).

## IMPORTANT DATES

- Submission deadline: **April 24, 2020**
- Acceptance notification: **May 24, 2020**
- Camera ready deadline: May 31, 2020
- Workshop date: TBD (one day of July 11-13, 2020)

# Program Schedule
